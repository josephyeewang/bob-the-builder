# Bob the Builder — Build Protocol for Claude Code

## What This Is

A systematic framework for building, auditing, and evolving products with Claude Code. Optimized for a non-engineer product leader who is strong at conceptual scoping and relies on AI for implementation.

## How to Use

Tell Claude Code to read `build-protocol.md`. For first-time users, Claude will show a Journey Map (the full path from idea to launch) before asking which mode applies:

- **NEW** — Build a new product from scratch
- **AUDIT** — Assess an existing product
- **EVOLVE** — Add features or make changes

**Narrator Mode (v2.3) is silently ON by default.** Claude announces what's about to happen at every step, explains jargon inline, and summarizes progress after each completion. Claude does NOT announce that narrator mode is on at session start — it's the default, just be in it. Say "terse mode" anytime to switch to a quieter pace.

**Streamlined startup (v2.9).** When the skill is invoked, Claude asks exactly ONE question — *which mode (NEW / AUDIT / EVOLVE)*. Everything else (first-time detection, project sensing, complexity classification, housekeeping flags) is silent or proposed in a single narration block. No "is this the first time?" / "narrator on or terse?" / "does this map look right?" gates.

For daily use, load `build-protocol-core.md` (compact reference). Load `build-protocol.md` (full reference) when you need templates, appendices, or architecture patterns.

## File Structure

```
build-protocol.md          ← Full reference (all sections, templates, appendices)
build-protocol-core.md     ← Compact reference (~200 lines) for session context
templates/                  ← Extractable templates (phase report, behavioral core, etc.)
README.md                   ← Public-facing project overview
```

## Key Rules

- Follow steps in order. Stop at every human gate (`→ HG`).
- Specs are living documents — update them during build, not just at the beginning.
- Reconciliation after every phase is non-optional.
- No silent refactoring. No behavior drift. No scope creep.
- When compacting, always preserve: current mode, current step, and any pending decisions.

## Success metrics (v2.11 — dogfooding Step 1a)

Bob's Step 1a requires every product to declare success metrics. Bob is a product. Here are its.

- **Self-effectiveness** — Bob can audit and evolve Bob (Bob-on-Bob). Demonstrated across v2.2 → v2.11 (10+ EVOLVE cycles applied to the protocol itself). *Current: passing.*
- **Fix-commit ratio in projects using Bob** — target <30% (baseline: prior projects ran 70%). *Current: unmeasured externally; requires per-project manual git-log analysis. See A7g findings (v2.10 changelog).*
- **Deviation count declining over consecutive phases** — Build Manifest tracks this column per phase. *Current: unmeasured at adoption scale.*
- **Audit findings at hardening** — target <10 critical items at Step [N+1]. *Current: unmeasured externally.*
- **Non-engineer can complete a build end-to-end without engineer hand-holding** — qualitative. *Current: Joe (target persona) is the only verified data point.*

**Honest gap:** four of five metrics above are structurally unmeasured because Bob has no telemetry by design. The Step [N+2] PR-back template (v2.11) is the lightweight feedback mechanism — users self-report after building with Bob. Don't expect statistical signal soon; expect a slow trickle of anecdotes.
