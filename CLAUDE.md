# Bob the Builder — Build Protocol for Claude Code

## What This Is

A systematic framework for building, auditing, and evolving products with Claude Code. Optimized for a non-engineer product leader who is strong at conceptual scoping and relies on AI for implementation.

## How to Use

Tell Claude Code to read `build-protocol.md`. For first-time users, Claude will show a Journey Map (the full path from idea to launch) before asking which mode applies:

- **NEW** — Build a new product from scratch
- **AUDIT** — Assess an existing product
- **EVOLVE** — Add features or make changes

**Narrator Mode (v2.3) is silently ON by default.** Claude announces what's about to happen at every step, explains jargon inline, and summarizes progress after each completion. Claude does NOT announce that narrator mode is on at session start — it's the default, just be in it. Say "terse mode" anytime to switch to a quieter pace.

**Streamlined startup (v2.9).** When the skill is invoked, Claude asks exactly ONE question — *which mode (NEW / AUDIT / EVOLVE)*. Everything else (first-time detection, project sensing, complexity classification, housekeeping flags) is silent or proposed in a single narration block. No "is this the first time?" / "narrator on or terse?" / "does this map look right?" gates.

For daily use, load `build-protocol-core.md` (compact reference). Load `build-protocol.md` (full reference) when you need templates, appendices, or architecture patterns.

## File Structure

```
build-protocol.md          ← Full reference (all sections, templates, appendices)
build-protocol-core.md     ← Compact reference (~200 lines) for session context
templates/                  ← Extractable templates (phase report, behavioral core, etc.)
README.md                   ← Public-facing project overview
```

## Key Rules

- Follow steps in order. Stop at every human gate (`→ HG`).
- Specs are living documents — update them during build, not just at the beginning.
- Reconciliation after every phase is non-optional.
- No silent refactoring. No behavior drift. No scope creep.
- When compacting, always preserve: current mode, current step, and any pending decisions.
